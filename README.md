            <li>
                In this classification project we will be using the length and widths of the flower's sepal and petals
                to predict which of these three types of iris the flower is. If our model works well, we will be able to
                apply it to unseen data -- allowing us to predict the type of flower without knowing its true class.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our goal is to create a Logistic Regression classification model that will predict which class the
                flower is based on petal and sepal size

                <p>The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A. Fisher. The dataset is taken
                    from Fisher's paper. Note that it's the same as in R, but not as in the UCI
                    Machine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.
                    This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the
                    pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and
                    is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The
                    data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a
                    type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the
                    latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

                <h2>What is our problem and what should we do?</h2>
                <p>
                    We have four characteristics of these three types of flowers, and using these characteristics(sepal
                    length,sepal width,petal length and petal width) for predict which class the Iris belongs
                    to(setosa,Versicolor or virginica).
                    We use Classification to solve this issue
